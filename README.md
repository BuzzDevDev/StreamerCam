## Funny Pictures = Good Webcam

No webcam? No problem!

StreamerCam lets you use a set of images or frames to make a "webcam" that animates by the volume you speak!

Any bugs? Any features you want implemented? [Request or report](https://github.com/BuzzDevDev/StreamerCam/issues) it or fork our repository!
